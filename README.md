# Spark Sport Test 
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
Express is used for the backend with axios as the api library and semantic-ui-react as the view library.

Run npm install to install packages and npm run start to run the dev server. To run the backend use npm run serve, without this the api won't work.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run serve`

Runs the express server.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
